Install the following dependencies:
(sudo apt-get install <name>)

- libc++-dev
- libc++abi-dev


Get depot_tools from the chromium git

-  git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git


Prepend depot_tools to $PATH, preferably in .bashrc

-  export PATH=`pwd`/path/to/depot_tools:"$PATH"


Run the following commands in the directory where you want to save V8:

-  gclient
-  fetch v8
-  cd v8
-  gclient sync


Generate GN files

-  python "tools/dev/v8gen.py" x64.debug
-  python "tools/dev/v8gen.py" x64.release


Generate Ninja files
(A text editor will open, probably VIM, copy the arguments from 'v8_args.x64.<configuration>.gn' in snuffbox-javascript)

-  gn args "out.gn/x64.debug"
-  gn args "out.gn/x64.release"


Compile with Ninja (-v for verbose logging, make sure it's compiling with g++)

-  ninja [-v] -C "out.gn/x64.debug"
-  ninja [-v] -C "out.gn/x64.release"


As for linking; link order is important here. This configuration seems to work without problems

-  libv8_libplatform 
-  libv8_base 
-  libv8_libbase 
-  libv8_snapshot 
-  libv8_libsampler 
-  libv8_nosnapshot 
-  libicui18n 
-  libicuuc
-  libc++ 
-  libc++abi
